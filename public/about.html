<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>I grew up in South Jersey, where I developed an early interest in technology through my very voracious video game addiction. 
  The early years spent browsing the internet looking for game guides and forums, and also really nerding out in my high school keyboarding class.</p>

<p>In college I majored in Liberal Arts with a Political Science minor (yes, yes... I know all the jokes) with the goal of becoming a police officer. 
  Life had other plans and it never panned out due to some sports injuries, which in retrospect I am thankful for. I eventually ended up working at a home automation company working at the very bottom of the chain in their warehouse.
  I worked my way up and around there, gaining all sorts of different experience. Warehouse, Customer Service, Team Lead, Accounting, and eventually Tech Support. </p>

<p>After the birth of my child, I took some time off and eventually returned to the professional community working for a customer of my former company in the Charlotte area. 
  There I was the Service Manager, taking my passion for technology and learning that has now only grown and applying it to the business of smart homes. 
  I fixed problems, and also dispatched technicians when I was unable to do it remotely. A few times a week, I dispatched myself to fix the issues! 
  I learned so much during this time, and am extremely grateful to the company for taking a chance on me. I would still be there, if my husband hadn't gotten a job offer we couldn't refuse! 
  I took time off again to care for our child and in doing so decided to learn Web Development, which brings us to today.</p>
